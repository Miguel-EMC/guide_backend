# Backend Development Guides

Welcome to my collection of guides and example projects for various backend frameworks! The purpose of this repository is to provide clear, concise documentation alongside functional code examples.

## Repository Structure

Each framework has its own directory, which is divided into two parts:

-   `guide/`: Contains the documentation and theoretical explanations in Markdown format.
-   `example_project/`: Contains a complete and functional code project to practice the concepts from the guide.
