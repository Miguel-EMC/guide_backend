# 31 - Spring Cloud

Spring Cloud is a project that provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state).

To use Spring Cloud, you will need to add the appropriate Spring Cloud starter dependencies to your project. For example, to use the Spring Cloud Config Server, you would add the `spring-cloud-config-server` dependency.

Once you have added the dependencies, you can enable the Spring Cloud features by adding the appropriate annotation to your application. For example, to enable the Config Server, you would add the `@EnableConfigServer` annotation.
